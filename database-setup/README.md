## Database

Please use following convention:
- username: `sa` (default)
- password: `TAB_DRA1`
- port: `1433` (default)

## Docker

Database can be set up as a docker container to minimize trash content on your PC.

Docker for Windows can be downloaded [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/).

When you have docker installed, just double-click the .cmd file to pull and run the SQLServer 2019 image - it should appear in your docker GUI right after.
Every next time, just run it from GUI.
